                <p>On the day we met for the first time, February 15th, we talked about so many random things. I remember we talked about how uncle used to play tournaments and I could relate because my papa used to as well.</p>
                <p>The way you popped up in the DMs was actually funny. We talked about so much, you told me about your hostel adventures and I was just like, "Damn, so much is happening here, this girl is cool" and I just loved how enthusiastically you were telling me those things. That was my kind of crazy.</p>

                <p>I didn't realize it at first but my favorite place to be slowly became wherever you were. Whether we were lost in a game on Roblox or just sitting together in silence, everything felt more complete with you there.</p>
                <p>It made me realize how much I had fallen for you. I was so nervous to tell you after all this time but finally opening up to you made that the best day I have ever had and that day changed everything for the better.</p>

                <p>Honestly baby, life is just better with you in it. Every day by your side is like a page from a storybook I never want to close, literally the best part of both my reality and my imagination.</p>
                <p>You make the bad days bearable and the good days incredible. It feels almost impossible to find someone who is both your love and your best friend, but I found that in you. Thanks for being my person. I am so lucky to be yours.</p>
